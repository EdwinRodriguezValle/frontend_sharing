## Justification

Unfortunate, I could not finish this app because I did not succeed building the backend. 
Even I develop everything, after writing the security configuration and authentication i could not succeed  making run the end points.

I do not know how to justify why I choose this way of building this app. 
I just followed what we have studied in the EdHub course and all the guiltiness provided in the finally assigment. I this not choose anything on my onw to justify why I chose this one.
